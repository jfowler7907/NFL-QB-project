Does draft round have any bearing on QB career performance.

Visualizations
- Quarterback rating over time.
- Bar - AVG stats vs league average.
- Which group had the highest average stats.
- Individual QB stats by round drafted.

Project Description
We are going to explore whether the round and/or position a quarterback was drafted is representative of their career performance. We intend to look at carrer statistics/performance measurements as part of our analysis. We plan on querying API's and possibly using existing CSV files in our analysis. We plan on creating a dashboard to present our data that utilizes Flask, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQLite.
